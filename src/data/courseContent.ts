**(0:15-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN (Friendly, enthusiastic tone):** "Hi everyone, and welcome\\! I'm so excited to have you join me on this journey. In this course, we're going to build an amazing portfolio website, even if you've never coded before. It's going to be fun, hands-on, and by the end, you'll have your very own website online\\!"

**(0:30-0:45) HOST ON SCREEN / GRAPHIC OVERLAY (Simple, clear icons appear as mentioned):** "Think of building a website like building with LEGOs. **HTML** is the instruction manual – the bones of our creation. **CSS** is the paint and decorations – making it look fantastic. And we'll use a special text editor, our 'digital workshop,' to write these instructions. That workshop is called **VS Code**."

**(0:45-1:45) SCREENSHARE: Demonstrating VS Code Download (Show browser, search, click, download button)HOST VOICE OVER:** "Your first step is to get your digital workshop ready. Open your web browser – like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 1.2 \\- Your First Webpage: index.html"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe a file icon transforming into a browser tab.)*

**(0:10-0:40) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (VS Code open to \`MyPortfolioWebsite\` folder):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! In our last lesson, we set up our project folder in VS Code. Now, let's create the very first file for our website: \`index.html\`. This is the main page that web browsers will look for when someone visits your site, so its name is very important\\!"

"In VS Code, on the left sidebar, make sure you're looking at your \`MYPORTFOLIOWEBSITE\` folder. You'll see a few icons appear when you hover over it. We want the 'New File' icon – it looks like a document with a plus sign. Click it." *(Visual: Highlight the 'New File' icon in the VS Code sidebar.)*

To get a basic HTML structure quickly, type an **exclamation mark** (\`!\`) and then press the **Tab** key on your keyboard." *(Visual: Show typing \`!\`, then pressing \`Tab\`, and the boilerplate code instantly appearing.)* "Whoa\\! VS Code automatically fills in a basic HTML structure for us. This is called **boilerplate code**, and it's the standard starting point for almost every HTML page."

**(1:20-2:45) SCREENSHARE (Highlighting each tag as explained):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Let's quickly understand what all this code means, line by line, so you know what you're working with:"

* "\`<!DOCTYPE html>\`: This simply tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document, which is the latest version of HTML." *(Visual: Highlight \`<!DOCTYPE html>\`.)*  
* \`<html lang="en">\`: "This is the very first tag that wraps around our entire webpage. \`lang="en"\` just tells browsers that the primary language of our content is English." *(Visual: Highlight \`<html lang="en">\` and \`</html>\`.)*  
* \`<head>\`: "This section is like the 'brain' of our webpage. It contains information the browser needs to know about the page, but the user doesn't directly see on the page itself. Things like character sets for proper text display, and how our site looks on different devices." *(Visual: Highlight \`<head>\` and \`</head>\`.)*  
* \`<meta charset="UTF-8">\`: "Don't worry too much about this one. It ensures that all text characters on your page display correctly, no matter what language or symbols you use." *(Visual: Highlight \`<meta charset="UTF-8">\`.)*  
* \`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">\`: "This is super important for modern websites\\! It tells the browser how to scale the page to look good on different screens, especially phones and tablets." *(Visual: Highlight \`<meta name="viewport" ...>\`.)*  
* \`<title>Document</title>\`: "This is the text that appears right in the browser tab or window title bar. Right now, it says 'Document.' We'll change this in a second\\!" *(Visual: Highlight \`<title>Document</title>\`.)*  
* \`<body>\`: "This is where all the fun stuff goes\\! Every single piece of content you *see* on the actual website – your text, images, buttons, everything – lives inside these \`<body>\` tags." *(Visual: Highlight \`<body>\` and \`</body>\`.)*

**(2:45-3:15) SCREENSHARE (Changing title, showing final code block):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Let's personalize that title in the browser tab. Inside the \`<title>\` tags, carefully delete the word \`Document\`." *(Visual: Show cursor deleting 'Document'.)* "Now, type \`My Awesome Portfolio\`." *(Visual: Show typing 'My Awesome Portfolio'.)* "Your entire \`index.html\` file should now look exactly like this:"

Find the \`index.html\` file you just created and double-click it." *(Visual: Show navigating to the folder, highlighting \`index.html\`, and double-clicking.)* "It will open in your web browser. You'll see a blank page for now, but look closely at the browser tab\\! It should now say 'My Awesome Portfolio'. Success\\! You've created your very first webpage\\!" *(Visual: Show the browser opening, highlighting the tab title.)*

**(3:45-4:00) HOST ON SCREEN / OUTRO:** "Awesome\\! We've created our first HTML file and changed its title. In our next lesson, we'll start adding actual content to the page, like headings and paragraphs, so it's not so blank anymore\\! Keep up the great work, and I'll see you then\\!" *(Visual: Host smiling, maybe a "Next Lesson" graphic.)*

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 2.1 \\- Your Style Sheet: style.css"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe a CSS icon or a paint brush.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing plain \`index.html\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back, web creators\\! Our portfolio is taking shape with its sections, but let's be honest, it's pretty plain. All the text is black, on a white background, and it's all aligned to the center. That's where **CSS** comes in – it's the magic wand for styling\\!"

"Today, we're going to create our \`style.css\` file and, crucially, link it to our \`index.html\` so our website knows where to find its style instructions. This is the first step to making your site look amazing\\!"

**(0:30-1:15) SCREENSHARE (Creating \`style.css\` file in VS Code):HOST VOICE OVER:** "First, let's create our CSS file. In VS Code, make sure you're in your \`MYPORTFOLIOWEBSITE\` folder on the left sidebar. Click on the 'New File' icon, just like we did for \`index.html\`." *(Visual: Highlight the 'New File' icon in the VS Code sidebar.)* "This time, type \`style.css\` and press **Enter**." *(Visual: Show typing \`style.css\` into the box, then the blank \`style.css\` file opening in the main editor area.)* "You should now see a blank \`style.css\` file open in your editor, right next to \`index.html\`. This is where all our styling rules will live."

**(1:15-2:45) SCREENSHARE (Adding \`<link>\` tag in \`index.html\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Now, we need to tell our \`index.html\` page to *use* this \`style.css\` file. We do this with a special HTML tag called \`<link>\`. Go back to your \`index.html\` tab in VS Code." *(Visual: Click on the \`index.html\` tab.)*

"Remember the \`<head>\` section? That's where we put information for the browser. We'll add our link tag there. Find the line with your \`<title>\` tag. On a new line, right after your \`<title>My Awesome Portfolio</title>\` tag but *before* the closing \`</head>\` tag, type this exact code:"

HTML  
\\<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"\\>

*(Visual: Show typing the \`<link>\` tag.)* "Let's break down this tag:"

* "\`rel="stylesheet"\`: This tells the browser that the file we're linking is a stylesheet, specifically for styling."  
* "\`href="style.css"\`: This is the most important part\\! It's the **path** to our CSS file. Since \`style.css\` is in the *same folder* as \`index.html\`, we just need to give its name."

"Your \`<head>\` section should now look exactly like this:"

HTML  
\\<head\\>  
    \\<meta charset="UTF-8"\\>  
    \\<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"\\>

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 2.2 \\- Backgrounds & Text Colors"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe a color palette icon.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` with plain text on white background):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! Our \`style.css\` is linked, so now we can finally write some CSS to make our page look much better. Today, we're going to change the overall background color of our page and the colors of our text. This is where you start to see your design come to life\\!"

**(0:30-1:45) SCREENSHARE (Typing \`body\` rule in \`style.css\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Let's start by changing the background color of our entire webpage. Remember, all our visible content is inside the \`<body>\` tag in HTML. So, we'll target the \`body\` element in CSS."

"Open your \`style.css\` file in VS Code. On a new line, type \`body {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`body {\`.)* "VS Code will automatically add the closing curly brace \`}\`. Press **Enter** to move to the next line and indent – VS Code does this automatically for good code formatting." *(Visual: Show pressing Enter, cursor indents.)* "Now, let's set the background color. Type \`background-color: lightgray;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`background-color: lightgray;\`.)* "Remember the semicolon at the end of every CSS property-value pair – it's crucial\\! Now, let's set a default text color for all content inside the \`body\`. Type \`color: #333;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`color: #333;\`.)* "This \`#333\` is a **hex code**, a way to represent colors using a combination of numbers and letters. It's a dark grey. You can also use common color names like \`red\`, \`blue\`, or \`green\`, but hex codes give you much more control. An online hex color picker can help you find any color you want\\!"

"Your \`body\` rule should now look exactly like this:"

CSS  
body {  
    background-color: lightgray;  
    color: \\#333;  
}

**(1:45-2:45) SCREENSHARE (Typing \`h1\` rule in \`style.css\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Now, let's make our main heading, your \`<h1>Hello, I'm Alex!</h1>\`, a different color to make it stand out. On a new line after your \`body\` rule, type \`h1 {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`h1 {\`.)* "Inside, type \`color: #007bff;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`color: #007bff;\`.)* "Then add the closing curly brace \`}\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`}\`.)* "Your \`style.css\` should now have both rules, like this:"

CSS  
body {  
    background-color: lightgray;  
    color: \\#333;  
}

h1 {

#### **Lesson 2.3: Spacing Things Out: Margins and Padding**

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 2.3 \\- Spacing Out: Margins and Padding"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe a diagram of a box with arrows indicating space.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` with new colors):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! Our webpage is looking more colorful now. But you might notice everything is a bit squished against the edges of the browser, and the text lines are very close together. Today, we're going to learn about two fundamental CSS properties: **margins** and **padding**. These are essential for creating professional-looking layouts and giving your content room to breathe\\!"

**(0:30-1:30) SCREENSHARE (Visual explanation of Box Model):HOST VOICE OVER:** "To truly understand margins and padding, imagine that *every single HTML element* on your page, whether it's a heading, a paragraph, or a section, is like a **box**. This is called the **CSS Box Model**." *(Visual: Show a simple diagram of the Box Model. Start with "Content".)* "Inside the box is your **content** – that's your actual text or images." *(Visual: Highlight "Content".)* "Directly around that content is **padding**. Padding is the space *inside* the box, pushing the content away from the box's edges. Think of it like the cushioning inside a package." *(Visual: Add "Padding" layer around content.)* "Then, there's the **border**, which is the actual edge of the box itself. We haven't added any yet, but you can." *(Visual: Add "Border" layer.)* "And finally, **margin** is the space *outside* the box, pushing other boxes or elements away from it. Think of it as the empty space between packages on a shelf." *(Visual: Add "Margin" layer around the border.)*

**(1:30-2:30) SCREENSHARE (Adding \`padding\` to \`body\` in \`style.css\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Let's start with **padding**. We'll add some space *inside* our main \`body\` element, pushing all our content away from the very edges of the browser window. This gives your page a nice, clean border." "Open your \`style.css\` file in VS Code. Go to your \`body\` rule. On a new line, after \`color: #333;\`, type \`padding: 20px;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`padding: 20px;\`.)* "The \`px\` stands for 'pixels,' a common unit of measurement for screen elements. \`20px\` means 20 pixels of space on all four sides: top, right, bottom, and left." "Your \`body\` rule should now look like this:"

CSS  
body {  
    background-color: lightgray;  
    color: \\#333;  
    padding: 20px; /\\* New line: space inside the body \\*/  
}

**(2:30-3:15) SCREENSHARE (Adding \`margin-bottom\` to \`h1\` in \`style.css\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Now, let's add some **margin** – space *outside* our \`<h1>\` heading – to create a small, clear gap between it and the content below it. This makes the text easier to read." "Go to your \`h1\` rule in \`style.css\`. On a new line inside the \`h1\` rule, after \`color: #007bff;\`, type \`margin-bottom: 10px;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`margin-bottom: 10px;\`.)* "This specific property, \`margin-bottom\`, only adds space to the bottom of the element, pushing the next element down." "Your \`h1\` rule should now look like this:"

CSS  
h1 {  
    color: \\#007bff;  
    margin-bottom: 10px; /\\* New line: space outside, below h1 \\*/  
}

**(3:15-3:45) SCREENSHARE (Saving \`style.css\`, refreshing browser, demonstrating changes):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Time to see the difference\\! Save your \`style.css\` file. Refresh your browser. Notice how your content is now pushed slightly inward from the browser edges, and there's a small, clear gap between your \`<h1>\` and the \`<h2>\` below it. Much cleaner and easier on the eyes\\!" *(Visual: Show the browser with the new padding and margin applied.)*

"**Quick Challenge:** Try changing \`padding\` to \`50px\` or \`margin-bottom\` to \`50px\` to really see how much space they add\\! Then, change them back to \`20px\` and \`10px\` respectively." *(Visual: Briefly show changing values and the dramatic effect, then changing back.)*

**(3:45-4:00) HOST ON SCREEN / OUTRO:** "Great job mastering margins and padding\\! These are crucial for good web design and layout. In our next lesson, we'll dive into changing fonts and text alignment to give your website even more personality. See you there\\!" *(Visual: Host smiling, maybe a "Next Lesson" graphic.)*

#### **Lesson 2.4: Changing Fonts & Text Alignment**

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 2.4 \\- Changing Fonts & Text Alignment"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe a font icon or text alignment icon.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` with current styling):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Hello, future web designers\\! We've got colors and spacing down. Now, let's inject some personality into our text by changing fonts and adjusting their alignment. The right font can completely change the feel of your website, making it more inviting or professional\\!"

**(0:30-1:30) SCREENSHARE (Changing \`font-family\` for \`body\` in \`style.css\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "First, let's change the default font for all the text on our page. This is usually done on the \`body\` element, so all text inside it inherits that font. Open your \`style.css\` file." "In your \`body\` rule, on a new line after \`padding: 20px;\`, type \`font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\`.)* "A quick note on \`font-family\`: you can list multiple fonts separated by commas. The browser will try to use the first one available on the user's computer. If 'Arial' isn't found, it will try the next, and so on. \`sans-serif\` is a generic fallback that means 'any font without those little decorative feet at the ends of letters,' ensuring your text always looks good even if specific fonts aren't available." "Your \`body\` rule should now look like this:"

CSS  
body {  
    background-color: lightgray;  
    color: \\#333;  
    padding: 20px;  
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif; /\\* New line \\*/  
}

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (VS Code open to \`index.html\` with \`h1\`, \`h2\`, \`p\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! Our webpage is coming along nicely with colors and fonts. But right now, all our content is just flowing down the page. Today, we're going to organize our website into distinct **sections** in our HTML, giving it a clear and professional structure. We've already added placeholder sections in Lesson 1.4, now we'll solidify them\\!"

**(0:30-1:30) SCREENSHARE (Wrapping existing content in \`<section id="home">\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Every good website is broken down into logical pieces, or **sections**. Think of them like chapters in a book. Our portfolio will have sections like 'Home,' 'About Me,' 'Skills,' and 'Projects.' We use the HTML tag \`<section>\` to create these."

"Let's wrap our existing content – your \`<h1>\`, \`<h2>\`, and \`<p>\` – into a 'Home' section. In your \`index.html\`, find your \`<h1>Hello, I'm Alex!</h1>\`." *(Visual: Highlight the \`<h1>\` line.)* "Above that line, on a new line, type the opening tag for our home section: \`<section id="home">\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`<section id="home">\`.)* "Now, go below your \`<p>Welcome to my portfolio...\` line.

#### **Lesson 3.3: Creating a Navigation Bar**

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 3.3 \\- Creating a Navigation Bar"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe a navigation menu icon or an arrow pointing between sections.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` with styled sections):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! Our portfolio is looking great with its distinct sections. But right now, to see all of them, you have to scroll down. That's not very user-friendly\\! Today, we're going to build a **navigation bar** at the top of our site, allowing visitors to easily jump between your sections with a click. This involves two new HTML tags: \`<header>\` and \`<nav>\`."

**(0:30-1:30) SCREENSHARE (Adding \`<header>\` and \`<nav>\` in \`index.html\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Open your \`index.html\` file. The navigation bar usually sits at the very top of a website, so it's the first thing visitors see. We'll place it right inside the \`<body>\` tags, but *before* your \`<section id="home">\`." *(Visual: Highlight the space just after \`<body>\`.)* "On the very first line inside your \`<body>\`, type the opening tag for our header: \`<header>\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`<header>\`.)* "Inside this \`<header>\`, add a \`<nav>\` tag. \`nav\` stands for navigation, and it's specifically for navigation links." *(Visual: Show typing \`<nav>\`.)* "Your structure should now look like this:"

HTML  
\\<body\\>  
    \\<header\\>

    \\</section\\>  
    \\<\\!-- ... other sections ... \\--\\>  
\\</body\\>

"The \`<header>\` tag semantically defines introductory content, like a logo or a group of navigational links. The \`<nav>\` tag explicitly defines a block of navigation links, which is good for accessibility."

**(1:30-2:45) SCREENSHARE (Adding Navigation Links using \`<ul>\`, \`<li>\`, \`<a>\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Now, let's add the actual links inside our \`<nav>\` tag. We'll use an **unordered list** (\`<ul>\`) to hold our navigation items, and each item will be a **list item** (\`<li>\`) containing an **anchor tag** (\`<a>\`) for the link." "Inside your \`<nav>\` tags, on a new line, type the opening tag for an unordered list: \`<ul>\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`<ul>\`.)* "Now, for each section we have (\`home\`, \`about\`, \`skills\`), we'll create a list item and a link. The \`href\` attribute of the link will point to the \`id\` of our sections using a hashtag (\`#\`)." "Type this exact code inside your \`<ul>\`:"

HTML  
   \\<ul\\>  
        \\<li\\>\\<a href="\\#home"\\>Home\\</a\\>\\</li\\>  
        \\<li\\>\\<a href="\\#about"\\>About\\</a\\>\\</li\\>

*(Visual: Show typing each \`<li><a>\` line.)* "Notice \`href="#home"\` links to our section with \`id="home"\`. The text 'Home' is what the user will click to jump to that section."

Save your \`index.html\` file by going to **File \\> Save** or using the shortcut **Ctrl+S** / **Cmd+S**." *(Visual: Show saving file.)* "Go back to your browser and refresh. You'll see an unstyled list of links at the very top of your page. Go ahead and click one – like 'About.' It should instantly scroll you down to your 'About Me' section\\! How cool is that? You've just made your website much easier to navigate\\!" *(Visual: Show browser, highlight unstyled nav, click a link and show page scrolling.)*

**(3:15-3:30) HOST ON SCREEN / OUTRO:** "Fantastic\\! You've just created a functional navigation bar.

#### **Lesson 3.4: Styling Your Navigation Bar (Flexbox Basic)**

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 3.4 \\- Styling Nav with Flexbox"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe a grid or layout icon.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` with unstyled nav):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! Our navigation bar is functional, but it's just a vertical list of underlined links right now. Not exactly 'sleek' or professional. Today, we're going to use some powerful CSS properties, specifically **Flexbox**, to transform it into a beautiful, horizontal menu that looks great at the top of our portfolio\\!"

**(0:30-1:15) SCREENSHARE (Styling the \`header\` in \`style.css\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Open your \`style.css\` file. First, let's style the overall \`<header>\` area, giving it a solid background color and some padding. On a new line, type \`header {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`header {\`.)* "Inside, add these properties:"

* \`background-color: #333;\` (This is a dark grey, matching our main text color.) *(Visual: Show typing \`background-color: #333;\`.)*  
* \`color: #fff;\` (This sets the default text color *inside* the header to white, so our links are visible.) *(Visual: Show typing \`color: #fff;\`.)*  
* \`padding: 15px 20px;\` (This adds some space around the navigation links inside the header.) *(Visual: Show typing \`padding: 15px 20px;\`.)* "Your \`header\` rule should look like this:"

CSS  
header {  
    background-color: \\#333; /\\* Dark grey \\*/  
    color: \\#fff; /\\* White text \\*/  
    padding: 15px 20px; /\\* 15px top/bottom, 20px left/right \\*/  
}

**(1:15-2:15) SCREENSHARE (Styling \`nav ul\` with Flexbox):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Now for the magic\\! We want our navigation list items (\`<li>\`) to go horizontal instead of vertical, and the easiest way to do that is with **Flexbox**. We apply Flexbox to the *container* of the items we want to arrange, which in our case is the \`<ul>\` tag inside the \`nav\`." "On a new line, type \`nav ul {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`nav ul {\`.)* "First, let's remove the default bullet points and any default padding from the list:"

* \`list-style: none;\` (This removes those pesky bullet points.) *(Visual: Show typing \`list-style: none;\`.)*  
* \`padding: 0;\` (This removes any default left padding that lists often have.) *(Visual: Show typing \`padding: 0;\`.)* "Now, for Flexbox\\! Add these two crucial lines:"  
* \`display: flex;\` (This is the key\\! It turns the \`<ul>\` into a flex container, making its direct children, the \`<li>\`s, arrange horizontally.) *(Visual: Show typing \`display: flex;\`.)*  
* \`justify-content: center;\` (This centers the flex items along the main horizontal axis, so our navigation links will be in the middle of the header.) *(Visual: Show typing \`justify-content: center;\`.)* "Your \`nav ul\` rule should now look like this:"

CSS  
nav ul {  
    list-style: none;  
    padding: 0;  
    display: flex; /\\* Makes items horizontal \\*/  
    justify-content: center; /\\* Centers items horizontally \\*/  
}

**(2:15-3:15) SCREENSHARE (Styling \`nav ul li a\` \\- Individual Links):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Our links are still underlined and a bit squished. Let's style the individual \`<a>\` tags that are inside our \`<li>\`s within the \`nav ul\`. On a new line, type \`nav ul li a {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`nav ul li a {\`.)* "Add these properties to make them look like proper menu buttons:"

* \`color: #fff;\` (This makes the link text white, so it stands out on the dark header.) *(Visual: Show typing \`color: #fff;\`.)*  
* \`text-decoration: none;\` (This removes the default underline from links.) *(Visual: Show typing \`text-decoration: none;\`.)*  
* \`padding: 10px 15px;\` (This adds space *inside* each clickable link area, making them easier to tap or click.) *(Visual: Show typing \`padding: 10px 15px;\`.)*  
* \`margin: 0 5px;\` (This adds a small gap *between* each link, so they don't touch.) *(Visual: Show typing \`margin: 0 5px;\`.)* "Your \`nav ul li a\` rule should look like this:"

CSS  
nav ul li a {  
    color: \\#fff;  
    text-decoration: none;  
    padding: 10px 15px;

Go back to your browser and refresh. Look at that\\! Your navigation bar is now a sleek, horizontal menu at the top of your page. It looks much more professional and is easy to use\\!" *(Visual: Show the browser with the new, styled navigation bar.)*

**(3:45-4:00) HOST ON SCREEN / OUTRO:** "Excellent work transforming your navigation\\! Flexbox is an incredibly powerful tool for layout.

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 4.1 \\- Adding Your Profile Picture"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe an image frame icon or a photo appearing.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` with current styling):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! Your portfolio is really coming alive with its structure and styling. Today, we're going to add a crucial visual element to your 'Home' section: your **profile picture**\\! This also means we'll learn about managing image files and understanding **file paths**, which is how your HTML finds your images."

**(0:30-1:15) SCREENSHARE (Creating \`images\` folder and placing mock image):HOST VOICE OVER:** "First, let's get our image ready. On your computer, navigate to your \`MyPortfolioWebsite\` folder. Inside this folder, we'll create a new folder specifically for all our images. Right-click on an empty space, select 'New Folder,' and name it \`images\`." *(Visual: Show creating the \`images\` folder.)* "Now, take a profile picture of yourself (or use the provided mock image, \`profile.jpg\`, from your course materials) and drag it into this new \`images\` folder. So, inside \`MyPortfolioWebsite\`, you should now have \`index.html\`, \`style.css\`, and an \`images\` folder containing your \`profile.jpg\`." *(Visual: Show dragging \`profile.jpg\` into the \`images\` folder.)*

**(1:15-2:45) SCREENSHARE (Adding \`<img>\` tag in \`index.html\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Now, let's add this image to our \`index.html\`. Open \`index.html\` in VS Code. We want the profile picture to appear in our \`home\` section, probably right before your name and title." "Find your \`<h1>Hello, I'm Alex!</h1>\` line inside \`<section id="home">\`." *(Visual: Highlight the \`<h1>\` line.)* "Above that \`<h1>\`, on a new line, type the opening tag for an image: \`<img src="\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`<img src="\`.)* "Now, this is the important part: the \`src\` (which stands for **source**) attribute tells the browser *where* to find the image file. Since our \`profile.jpg\` is inside the \`images\` folder, which is in the *same folder* as \`index.html\`, our path will be \`images/profile.jpg\`." *(Visual: Explain the path \`images/profile.jpg\` with an arrow pointing from \`index.html\` to \`images\` folder.)* "So, complete the \`src\` attribute by typing \`images/profile.jpg\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`images/profile.jpg\`.)* "Next, every image should have an \`alt\` attribute. This is important for **accessibility** (for screen readers used by visually impaired users) and also if the image fails to load. It provides alternative text. Type \`alt="Your Name Profile Picture">\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`alt="Your Name Profile Picture">\`.)* "The \`<img>\` tag is a **self-closing tag**, meaning it doesn't have a separate \`</img>\` closing tag." "Your \`home\` section should now look something like this:"

HTML  
\\<section id="home"\\>

#### **Lesson 4.2: Resizing & Styling Images (CSS)**

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 4.2 \\- Resizing & Styling Images"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe an image frame with a circular photo inside.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` with large image):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! Your profile picture is on the page, but it's probably taking up way too much space and looks a bit out of place. Today, we're going to use CSS to precisely control its size, make it a beautiful circular shape, and even add a nice border. This is where CSS truly lets you design your visuals\\!"

**(0:30-1:00) SCREENSHARE (Targeting \`<img>\` within \`#home\` in \`style.css\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Open your \`style.css\` file. We want to style *only* the image in our 'home' section, not every image on our entire website. So, we'll use a more specific CSS selector: \`#home img\`. This means 'target any \`<img>\` tag that is located *inside* an HTML element that has the ID of \`home\`'." *(Visual: Highlight \`#home img\` and explain the selector combination.)* "On a new line (you can put it after your \`footer\` rule for now, or near your other \`#home\` styles), type \`#home img {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`#home img {\`.)*

**(1:00-2:30) SCREENSHARE (Adding image styling properties):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Now, let's add the properties to resize and style our image."

* "First, let's set a fixed width and height to make it a manageable size. Type \`width: 150px;\` and \`height: 150px;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`width: 150px;\` and \`height: 150px;\`.)*  
* "To make it circular, we use \`border-radius: 50%;\`. This tells the browser to round the corners completely. If your width and height are equal, like ours are, it will form a perfect circle\\!" *(Visual: Show typing \`border-radius: 50%;\`.)*  
* "If your original image isn't perfectly square, it might look stretched when forced into a circle. \`object-fit: cover;\` is incredibly useful here. It makes the image 'fill' the 150px by 150px space without being distorted, cropping any excess parts of the image if needed." *(Visual: Show typing \`object-fit: cover;\`.)*  
* "Let's add a subtle blue border around our circular image. Type \`border: 3px solid #007bff;\` (3 pixels thick, a solid line, and in our portfolio blue color)." *(Visual: Show typing \`border: 3px solid #007bff;\`.)*  
* "Finally, add a little space below it to separate it from your name. Type \`margin-bottom: 20px;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`margin-bottom: 20px;\`.)* "Your \`#home img\` rule should look like this:"

CSS  
\\#home img {  
    width: 150px;  
    height: 150px;  
    border-radius: 50%;

We'll use a fantastic free library called **Font Awesome** to easily add these icons with just a line of HTML\\!"

**(0:30-1:45) SCREENSHARE (Adding Font Awesome CDN Link in \`index.html\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "To use Font Awesome icons, we need to tell our HTML where to find them. They're not on our computer; they're hosted on something called a **CDN**, a Content Delivery Network, which is like a super-fast online library that delivers common files to websites." "Open your \`index.html\` file in VS Code. Go to the \`<head>\` section, just before the closing \`</head>\` tag. We'll add a new \`<link>\` tag here, similar to how we linked our \`style.css\`."

The \`target="_blank"\` attribute simply tells the browser to open this link in a new tab, so visitors don't leave your portfolio."  
* \`<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>\`: The \`<i>\` tag is often used for icons. \`fab\` means 'Font Awesome Brands' (for social media icons), and \`fa-twitter\` is the specific icon name for Twitter. You can find names for hundreds of other icons on the Font Awesome website\\!"

#### **Lesson 5.3: Adding a Contact Section & Form (Basic HTML)**

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 5.3 \\- Contact Section & Form"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe an email icon or a contact form graphic.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` with current styling):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back, web builders\\! Your portfolio is almost complete. The last essential piece is a **Contact section**, making it easy for recruiters or potential clients to get in touch with you. We'll add a simple HTML form with input fields for name, email, and message, plus a submit button."

**(0:30-1:45) SCREENSHARE (Adding "Contact" Section HTML):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Open your \`index.html\` file. We'll add this new section right after our 'Projects' section. Scroll down to the closing \`</section>\` tag for \`id="projects"\`." *(Visual: Highlight the \`</section>\` tag for \`id="projects"\`.)* "On a new line below it, type the opening tag for your contact section: \`<section id="contact">\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`<section id="contact">\`.)* "Inside this section, first, add your heading and a short introductory paragraph. Type:"

HTML  
   \\<h2\\>Get In Touch\\!\\</h2\\>  
    \\<p\\>Have a question or want to work together? Send me a message\\!\\</p\\>

*(Visual: Show typing the \`<h2>\` and \`<p>\`.)* "Now, let's create the form itself using the \`<form>\` tag. This is the container for all our input fields and button. Still inside \`id="contact"\`, after the \`<p>\` tag, type \`<form>\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`<form>\`.)* "Inside the \`<form>\` tag, we'll add our input fields. Type these lines carefully:"

HTML  
       \\<input type="text" placeholder="Your Name" required\\>  
        \\<input type="email" placeholder="Your Email" required\\>  
        \\<textarea placeholder="Your Message" rows="5" required\\>\\</textarea\\>  
        \\<button type="submit"\\>Send Message\\</button\\>

*(Visual: Show typing each input and button line.)* "Let's quickly explain these new tags and attributes:"

* \`<input type="text">\`: This creates a single-line text input field for things like names."  
* \`<input type="email">\`: This creates a single-line input specifically for email addresses. Browsers can validate this automatically."  
* \`placeholder="..."\`: This text appears inside the empty field as a hint to the user, like 'Your Name'."  
* \`required\`: This attribute means the user *must* fill out this field before they can submit the form. If they try to submit an empty required field, the browser will show a warning."  
* \`<textarea>\`: This creates a multi-line text input field, perfect for longer messages. \`rows="5"\` makes it 5 lines tall by default."  
* \`<button type="submit">\`: This creates a button that, when clicked, will attempt to submit the form."

"Your complete 'Contact' section should now look like this:"

HTML  
\\<section id="contact"\\>  
    \\<h2\\>Get In Touch\\!\\</h2\\>  
    \\<p\\>Have a question or want to work together? Send me a message\\!\\</p\\>

\\</section\\>

**(1:45-2:45) SCREENSHARE (Adding a Footer \`<footer>\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Every professional website usually has a **footer** at the very bottom with copyright information or quick links.

Scroll back up to your \`<nav><ul>\` in \`index.html\`." *(Visual: Scroll up to the nav section.)* "Add a new list item right after 'Projects': \`<li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`<li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>\`.)* "Your navigation list should now look like this:"

HTML

\\</ul\\>

**(3:25-3:50) SCREENSHARE (Saving \`index.html\`, refreshing browser):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Time to see your new contact section and footer\\! Save your \`index.html\` file. Go back to your browser and refresh. You'll see your 'Get In Touch\\!' heading, the form fields, and your new footer appear at the bottom. It's functional, but definitely needs some styling to look good\\!" *(Visual: Show browser with new unstyled contact form and footer.)*

**(3:50-4:00) HOST ON SCREEN / OUTRO:** "Excellent\\! Your contact form and footer are in place. In our next lesson, we'll make this form look professional and user-friendly with some powerful CSS. Remember, this form is just for looks for now; making it actually send emails requires more advanced coding we won't cover in this beginner course.

#### **Lesson 6.1: Making Your Site Mobile-Friendly (Basic Responsiveness)**

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 6.1 \\- Mobile-Friendly Design"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe phone/tablet/desktop icons or a website shrinking/expanding.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN / SCREENSHARE (Browser showing \`index.html\` at full width):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Welcome back\\! Your portfolio looks fantastic on a large computer screen. But what happens when someone views it on a phone or a tablet? The navigation might be squished, or text might look too big. Today, we're going to learn the basics of **responsive design** using **media queries** in CSS, making your website look great on any screen size\\!"

**(0:30-1:15) SCREENSHARE (Explaining Media Queries & Initial Setup in \`style.css\`):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Responsive design is all about making your website adapt automatically to different screen sizes. A **media query** in CSS is like a special condition. It says, 'Hey, only apply these styles if the screen is, say, smaller than 768 pixels wide.' This lets us change fonts, layouts, or spacing specifically for mobile devices without affecting the desktop view."

"Open your \`style.css\` file. Scroll to the very bottom of the file, after all your existing CSS rules. On a new line, type \`@media (max-width: 768px) {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`@media (max-width: 768px) {\`.)* "Press Enter and then add a closing curly brace \`}\` on a new line. All the CSS rules we put *inside* this block will *only* apply when the browser window is 768 pixels wide or narrower. This is a common breakpoint for tablets and phones." *(Visual: Show pressing Enter, then typing \`}\`.)*

CSS  
/\\* ... all your existing CSS above ... \\*/

@media (max-width: 768px) {  
    /\\* Styles for screens 768px wide or less will go here \\*/  
}

**(1:15-2:15) SCREENSHARE (Adjusting \`#home\` h1 & Navigation for Small Screens):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Let's make our main \`<h1>\` title a bit smaller on phones, so it doesn't take up too much vertical space. Inside your new media query, on a new line, type \`#home h1 {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`#home h1 {\`.)* "Add \`font-size: 2.5em;\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`font-size: 2.5em;\`.)* "Type \`}\`."

"Now, let's make our navigation links stack vertically instead of horizontally when on a phone, as they're currently squished. Still inside the media query, on a new line, type \`nav ul {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`nav ul {\`.)* "Add \`flex-direction: column;\` (This changes the direction of the flex items from horizontal 'row' to vertical 'column')." *(Visual: Show typing \`flex-direction: column;\`.)* "Add \`align-items: center;\` (This centers the items horizontally when they're stacked vertically, keeping them neat)." *(Visual: Show typing \`align-items: center;\`.)* "Your media query should now look like this:"

CSS  
@media (max-width: 768px) {  
    \\#home h1 {  
        font-size: 2.5em;  
    }  
    nav ul {  
        flex-direction: column; /\\* Stacks nav items vertically \\*/  
        align-items: center; /\\* Centers stacked items \\*/  
    }  
}

**(2:15-3:00) SCREENSHARE (Adjusting Nav List Items for Mobile):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Finally for our navigation, let's add some vertical space between the stacked links so they're not touching. Still inside the media query, on a new line, type \`nav ul li {\`." *(Visual: Show typing \`nav ul li {\`.)* "Add \`margin: 5px 0;\` (5 pixels top/bottom margin, 0 left/right margin)." *(Visual: Show typing \`margin: 5px 0;\`.)* "Your complete media query should now include this:"

CSS  
@media (max-width: 768px) {  
    \\#home h1 {  
        font-size: 2.5em;  
    }  
    nav ul {  
        flex-direction: column;  
        align-items: center;  
    }  
    nav ul li {  
        margin: 5px 0; /\\* Adds vertical space between stacked links \\*/  
    }  
}

**(3:00-3:45) SCREENSHARE (Saving \`style.css\`, refreshing browser, demonstrating responsiveness):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Alright, save your \`style.css\` file. Now for the exciting part\\! Go back to your browser that has \`index.html\` open." "To test responsiveness, grab the right edge of your browser window and slowly drag it inward, making the window narrower. Watch closely as your navigation links stack vertically, and your main heading shrinks when the width goes below 768 pixels. Release the mouse, and you'll see the page re-adjust. This is your site being responsive\\!" *(Visual: Show the browser window being resized, highlighting the navigation and \`h1\` adapting.)*

**(3:45-4:00) HOST ON SCREEN / OUTRO:** "Fantastic\\! You've just made your website adapt to different screen sizes. This is a crucial step for any modern website, ensuring everyone has a great experience. In our very final lesson, we'll learn how to get your amazing website online for the whole world to see\\! Get ready to launch\\!" *(Visual: Host smiling, maybe a "Next Lesson" graphic.)*

#### **Lesson 6.2: From Your Computer to the World: Deploying with Netlify**

**Video Script:**

**(0:00-0:10) INTRO MUSIC & ANIMATED TITLE CARD: "Code Your Dream Portfolio: Lesson 6.2 \\- Deploying with Netlify"***(Visual: Music fades, lesson title animates in. Maybe a rocket launching or a globe icon.)*

**(0:10-0:30) HOST ON SCREEN:** "Welcome back for our final, incredibly exciting lesson\\! You've built an amazing, responsive portfolio website. But right now, it only lives on *your* computer. Today, we're going to fix that\\! We'll use a fantastic, free service called **Netlify** to publish your website online, so anyone in the world can see it\\!"

**(0:30-1:00) HOST ON SCREEN / GRAPHIC OVERLAY (Simple diagram of deployment):** "So, what exactly is **deployment**? Think of it like this: your website files are like a neatly packed box. To share it with the world, you need to mail it to a special post office, a 'server,' where everyone can access it through a web address. Netlify is like that super easy, free post office for websites\\!" *(Visual: Simple animation: Folder icon \\-\\> Cloud icon (server) \\-\\> Globe icon (internet access).)*

**(1:00-1:45) SCREENSHARE (Demonstrating Netlify sign-up):HOST VOICE OVER:** "First step, let's go to Netlify. Open your web browser and go to \`netlify.com\`. Look for a 'Sign up' button or 'Get started for free' and click it." *(Visual: Show navigating to \`netlify.com\`, highlighting 'Sign up'.)* "The easiest way to sign up is usually with your GitHub account if you have one, or you can use your email address. Choose your preferred method and follow the sign-up steps." *(Visual: Show sign-up options, briefly explain. Text overlay: "PAUSE VIDEO HERE".)* "Go ahead and **pause the video here** while you create your account. I'll wait\\!"

**(1:45-2:45) SCREENSHARE (Demonstrating Drag & Drop Deployment):HOST VOICE OVER:** "Alright, once you're logged into your Netlify dashboard, you'll see a section that says something like 'Add new site' or 'Deploy a new site.' You'll also see a big box that says 'Drag and drop your site folder here'." *(Visual: Highlight the drag-and-drop area on Netlify dashboard.)* "Now, this is the easiest way to deploy a simple website\\! Go to your computer's file explorer. Find your main \`MyPortfolioWebsite\` folder – the one that contains \`index.html\`, your \`style.css\` file, and your \`images\` folder. You need to drag the *entire folder*." *(Visual: Show navigating to \`MyPortfolioWebsite\` folder in file explorer.)* "Click and drag that whole \`MyPortfolioWebsite\` folder directly into that 'Drag and drop' box on the Netlify website. Release your mouse button." *(Visual: Show dragging the folder and dropping it.)* "Netlify will automatically start processing your files. It only takes a few seconds\\!" *(Visual: Show Netlify's deployment progress indicator.)*

**(2:45-3:30) SCREENSHARE (Viewing Live Site & Changing URL):HOST VOICE OVER:** "And just like that, congratulations\\! Your site is deployed\\! Netlify will give you a random, unique web address (like \`fluffy-cat-12345.netlify.app\`). Click on it\\!" *(Visual: Highlight the generated URL, click it, show the live website opening.)* "Your portfolio website is now live online for the whole world to see\\! How amazing is that?\\!"

"That random URL isn't very memorable, though. Let's change it to something nicer. Back in your Netlify dashboard, click on 'Site settings'." *(Visual: Click 'Site settings'.)* "Then, under the 'General' section, look for 'Change site name' and click that button." *(Visual: Highlight 'Change site name' button.)* "Type a more memorable name for your site, like \`yourname-awesome-portfolio\` (replacing 'yourname' with your actual name, of course\\!). Then click 'Save'." *(Visual: Show typing new name, clicking 'Save'.)* "Now, your website's address will be something like \`yourname-awesome-portfolio.netlify.app\`." *(Visual: Show the updated URL in Netlify.)*

**(3:30-4:00) HOST ON SCREEN / OUTRO:** "You did it\\! You've built a website from scratch and published it online. That is a massive achievement and a huge step in your web development journey\\! In our final quick lesson, we'll talk about what's next and how you can keep learning. See you in a moment\\!" *(Visual: Host smiling, maybe a "Next Lesson" graphic.)*

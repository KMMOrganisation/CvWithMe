# Welcome! Your Digital Workshop

## Introduction

Welcome to your web development journey! In this lesson, we'll set up your "digital workshop" - the tools you'll use to build your CV website. Think of this like setting up a carpenter's workshop before building furniture.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Download and install VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
- Create a project folder for your website
- Open your project in VS Code
- Understand the basic VS Code interface

## What You'll Need

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Internet connection
- About 30-45 minutes

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Understanding the Tools

Before we start, let's understand what we're building:

üí° **Think of a website like building with LEGOs:**
- **HTML** is the instruction manual (the structure/bones)
- **CSS** is the paint and decorations (making it look beautiful)
- **VS Code** is your digital workshop (where you write the instructions)

### Step 2: Download VS Code

VS Code is a free, powerful text editor that makes writing code easier and more enjoyable.

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
2. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. Click the big download button for your operating system
4. Follow the installation instructions for your computer

*The VS Code download page - click the download button for your system*

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pause here**: Take your time installing VS Code. The installation might take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.

### Step 3: Create Your Project Folder

Every website needs a home - a folder where all your files live.

1. On your computer, navigate to your Desktop or Documents folder
2. Right-click in an empty space (or two-finger click on Mac)
3. Select "New Folder" from the menu
4. Name your folder `MyPortfolioWebsite` (no spaces!)
5. Press Enter to create the folder

üí° **Pro Tip**: Avoid spaces in folder names for web projects. Use camelCase (like MyPortfolioWebsite) or hyphens (like my-portfolio-website) instead.

### Step 4: Open Your Project in VS Code

Now let's open your project folder in VS Code:

1. Open VS Code (you might see a welcome screen - you can close it)
2. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Open Folder...** (or **Open...** on Mac)
3. Navigate to your `MyPortfolioWebsite` folder
4. Click on the folder to select it
5. Click **Select Folder** (or **Open** on Mac)

If VS Code asks "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?", click **Yes, I trust the authors** (since you created it!).

*VS Code with your project folder open - notice the folder name in the sidebar*

### Step 5: Explore Your Digital Workshop

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with VS Code:

- **Sidebar (left)**: Shows your project files and folders
- **Main area (center)**: Where you'll write your code
- **Menu bar (top)**: File operations and settings
- **Status bar (bottom)**: Information about your project

## Practice Exercise

Let's make sure everything is working:

1. In the VS Code sidebar, you should see `MYPORTFOLIOWEBSITE` 
2. The folder should be empty (that's normal!)
3. Try clicking on different parts of the VS Code interface to get familiar with it

## Summary

Congratulations! You've successfully:
- Downloaded and installed VS Code
- Created your project folder
- Opened your project in VS Code
- Familiarized yourself with the VS Code interface

Your digital workshop is now ready! In the next lesson, we'll create your very first HTML file.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, "Your First Webpage: index.html", you'll:
- Create your first HTML file
- Learn about HTML document structure
- See your webpage in a browser for the first time

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: VS Code won't open or install
**Solution**: Make sure you downloaded the correct version for your operating system. Try restarting your computer and installing again.

**Problem**: Can't find the project folder
**Solution**: Remember where you created it (Desktop or Documents). You can also use the search function on your computer to find "MyPortfolioWebsite".

**Problem**: VS Code looks different from the screenshots
**Solution**: That's okay! VS Code can look slightly different on different operating systems, but the core functionality is the same.
